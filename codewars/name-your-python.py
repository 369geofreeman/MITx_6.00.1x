# name your Python

# For those of us who are not very familiar with Python, let's handle the very basic challenge of creating a class named Python. We want to give our Pythons a name, so it should take a name argument that we can retrieve later.
# 
# For example:
# 
# bubba = Python('Bubba')
# bubba.name # should return 'Bubba'




class Python:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name


bubba = Python('Bubba')

print(bubba.name == 'Bubba')
