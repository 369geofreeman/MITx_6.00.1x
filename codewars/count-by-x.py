#Â Count by x



# Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).
# 
# Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.
# 
# Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).
# 
# Examples:
# 
# count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]



def count_by(x, n):
    """
    Return a sequence of numbers counting by `x` `n` times.
    """
    return [i*x for i in range(1,n+1)]


print(count_by(1,10))
