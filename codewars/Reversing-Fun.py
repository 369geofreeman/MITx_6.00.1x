# Reversing Fun

# You are going to be given a string. Your job is to return that string in a certain order that I will explain below:
# 
# Let's say you start with this: 012345
# 
# The first thing you do is reverse it:543210
# Then you will take the string from the 1st position and reverse it again:501234
# Then you will take the string from the 2nd position and reverse it again:504321
# Then you will take the string from the 3rd position and reverse it again:504123
# 
# Continue this pattern until you have done every single position, and then you will return the string you have created. For this particular number, you would return:504132
# 
# #Input: A string of length 1 - 1000
# 
# #Output: A correctly reordered string.
