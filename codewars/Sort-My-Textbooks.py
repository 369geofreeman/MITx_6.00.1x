# Sort My Textbooks


# HELP! Jason can't find his textbook! It is two days before the test date, and Jason's textbooks are all out of order! Help him sort a list (ArrayList in java) full of textbooks by subject, so he can study before the test.
# 
# The sorting should NOT be case sensitive



def sorter(textbooks):
    return sorted(textbooks, key=str.lower)



print(sorter(['Algebra', 'History', 'Geometry', 'English']))
#['algebra', 'english', 'Geometry', 'History']
