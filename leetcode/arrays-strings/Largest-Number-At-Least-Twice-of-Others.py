# Largest-Number-At-Least-Twice-of-Others


# In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.
# 
# Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.
# 
# If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,
# 6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

    biggest = max(nums)
    for i in nums:
        if i != biggest and i*2 > biggest:
            return -1
    return nums.index(biggest)


print(dominantIndex([3, 6, 1, 0]))
#  >>> 1
print(dominantIndex([1, 2, 3, 4]))
#Â  >>> -1
print(dominantIndex([1, 2, 6, 20]))
#  >>> 3
