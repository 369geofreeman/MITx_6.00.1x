#Â Review

Let's briefly review the performance of the singly linked list and doubly linked list.

They are similar in many operations:

Both of them are not able to access the data at a random position in constant time.
Both of them are able to add a new node after given node or at the beginning of the list in O(1) time.
Both of them are able to delete the first node in O(1) time.
But it is a little different to delete a given node (including the last node).

In a singly linked list, it is not able to get the previous node of a given node so we have to spend O(N) time to find out the previous node before deleting the given node.
In a doubly linked list, it will be much easier because we can get the previous node with the "prev" reference field. So we can delete a given node in O(1) time.
 

Comparison
Here we provide a comparison of time complexity between the linked list and other data structures including array, queue and stack:

| Aspect                | Array                                                                   | Linked list                                                                               |   |   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|
|          Size         | - Fixed number - Size needs to be specific during declaration           | - Grow and contract size of insertions and deletions - Maximum size depends on heap       |   |   |
|    Storage capacity   |        - Static, it's location is allocated during compile time         | - Dynamic, it's location is located during run time                                       |   |   |
|  Ordering and sorting |                         - Stored consecutively                          | - Stored randomly                                                                         |   |   |
| Accessing the element | - Direct or random access method - Specify the array index or subscript | - Sequential access method - Traverse starting from the first node in the list by pointer |   |   |
|       Searching       |                     - Binary search or linear search                    | - Linear search                                                                           |   |   |


After this comparison, it is not difficult to come up with our conclusion:

If you need to add or delete a node frequently, a linked list could be a good choice.

If you need to access an element by index often, an array might be a better choice than a linked list.
