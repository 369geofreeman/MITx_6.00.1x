# Linear Search

### Size: Θ(n)
---

Grows at the same rate of the list/array

The worst-case running time of linear search grows like the array size n. The notation we use for this running time is Θ(n)

When we say that a particular running time is Θ(n), we're saying that once n gets large enough, the running time is at least k1*n and at most k2*n for some constants k1 and k2. Here's how to think of Θ(n)
