# Exercise: power recur

# In Problem 1, we computed an exponential by iteratively executing successive multiplications. We can use the same idea, but in a recursive function.
# Write a function recurPower(base, exp) which computes  baseexp  by recursively calling itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem,
# and then multiplying the result by base to solve the initial problem.
# This function should take in two values - base can be a float or an integer;
# exp will be an integer  â‰¥0 . It should return one numerical value.
# Your code must be recursive - use of the ** operator or looping constructs is not allowed


def recurPower(base, exp):
    '''
    base: int or float.
    exp: int >= 0

    returns: int or float, base^exp
    '''
    if exp == 1:
        return base
    return base * recurPower(base, exp - 1)


print(recurPower(2, 3))
